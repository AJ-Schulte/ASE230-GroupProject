## Abstract
The “Collectable Peddlers” Web Application aims to provide a simple, PHP-based online marketplace for users to buy and sell products, with a focus on trading cards, collectibles, and other niche goods. This application utilizes PHP and server-side rendering, ensuring lightweight functionality and accessibility even for users with limited browser support. The system will include core marketplace features such as user registration, product listings, search and filtering, transaction management, collection/list of items, and an administrative backend for moderation. By simplifying the buying and selling process, the platform creates a secure, community-driven environment that emphasizes trust and usability.
